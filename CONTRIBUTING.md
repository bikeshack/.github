# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to Bikeshed. We are excited about the prospect of you joining our [community](https://github.com/bikeshed/community)! The Bikeshed community abides by a standard open source [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Here is an excerpt:

_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._

## Getting Started

We have full documentation on how to get started contributing here:

<!---
If your repo has certain guidelines for contribution, put them here ahead of the general bikeshed resources
-->

- [Our Values](https://github.com/bikeshack/community/blob/main/values.md) We do our best to live our values in all contributions
- [Architectural Principles](https://github.com/bikeshack/tsc-docs/blob/main/Principles.md) We seek to uphold our principles with each change to any bikeshed code

## Quality Standards in Code Reviews

Don't get discouraged!  The first rule of open source contribution is, *"Yes is forever"*.  We are slow to adopt new ideas that we'll have to maintain for years to come specifically because we care about the long term success of the software here.  If you find that the team is slow to accept a PR and/or seems to be very picky with code standards, remember that these rules protect all of us.

### What can I do to be a better contributor?

- Review [Tim Hockin's Talk on Code Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZVv7-o8i40)([Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/thockin/how-to-be-a-bad-ass-code-reviewer))
- Better documentation for your PR helps us understand why the change is needed and what your code does.
- Code comments are great signposts to help us follow your logic.
- Smaller PRs are easier to review.  Can you split this up?
- Correctness proofs are awesome.  Include them in the description/readme/docs/tests wherever they are most appropriate for your code.
