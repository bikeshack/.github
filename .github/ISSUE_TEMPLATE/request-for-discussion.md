# Instructions (Delete me)

Writing down ideas is important:  it allows them to be rigorously formulated (even while nascent), candidly discussed and transparently shared.
We capture the written expression of an idea in a *Request for Discussion* (RFD), a document in the original spirit of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments[IETF Request for Comments], as expressed by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3[RFC 3]:

____
The content of a note may be any thought, suggestion, etc.
related to the software or other aspect of the network.
Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.
Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.
The minimum length for a note is one sentence.
____

____
These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas.
Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this inhibition.
____

Similar to RFCs, our philosophy of RFDs is to allow both timely discussion of rough ideas, while still becoming a permanent repository for more established ones.
Depending on their state, RFDs may be quickly iterated on in a branch, discussed actively as part of a pull request to be merged, or commented upon after having been published.
The workflow for the RFD process for is based upon those of the Golang proposal process, Joyent RFD process, Rust RFC process, and Kubernetes proposal process.

# Proposal Title

## What needs to change:

Describe the current state and your proposal for discussion.  For example: __We currently have three teapots in the office that are taking up space on the counter and using a lot of electricity to boil and re-boil water for tea.  Our tea-loving engineers can't efficiently caffeinate themselves with obvious productivity effects.__

## What do you propose?

Describe your proposed solution.  For example: __Installing a hot-tap in the sink would cost a relative pittance, including labor it will be $10.78 and provide unlimited 100C water for our tea drinkers.  I propose we allocate funds from the budget and ask our loving manager to submit the Work Order. __

## What alternatives exist?

Describe any alternatives you considered and why you discarded the.  For example:

- Campfire - not practical due to fire code
- Hire a designated tea-maker - not practical due to space and budgetary concerns
- Add a samovar of hot water next to the coffee maker - A samovar to match our current coffee maker would be more expensive than the hot-tap ($55.68) and would use more energy and counter space than a hot-tap.

## Other Considerations?

Hot Taps aren't great around small children.  I don't think we need to worry because none of our current staff have small children that they bring to the office, but we should make sure the installers keep it clearly labeled and out of reach of small children.
